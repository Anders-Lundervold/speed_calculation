Overview
This script, main.py, is part of a university project designed to analyze motion capture data and calculate running speed using two distinct methods: numerical differentiation and virtual timing gates. The script processes 3D marker trajectory data, validates the calculated speeds against a target speed, and generates visualizations and summary outputs for evaluation.

Features
Speed Calculation:

Numerical Differentiation: Calculates speed based on instantaneous velocity derived from positional data.
Virtual Timing Gates: Calculates speed based on the time taken to traverse a fixed distance between two predefined positions.
Validation:

Compares calculated speeds to a target speed with a specified tolerance range.
Outputs:

Saves results to an Excel file for comparison and further analysis.
Generates 2D plots for both speed calculation methods.
Creates 3D trajectory visualizations with timing gates.
Input Data
The script processes .tsv files containing 3D marker trajectory data. Each file must include the following columns:

SIPS_left X, SIPS_left Y, SIPS_left Z: Coordinates of the left posterior superior iliac spine (SIPS) marker.
SIPS_right X, SIPS_right Y, SIPS_right Z: Coordinates of the right posterior superior iliac spine (SIPS) marker.
How It Works
File Processing:

The script loops through all .tsv files in the specified input folder.
For each file, it extracts the midpoint trajectory of the left and right SIPS markers.
Speed Calculation:

Numerical Differentiation: Calculates the mean speed based on velocity derived from positional changes.
Virtual Timing Gates: Calculates the average speed based on the time taken to traverse the distance between two timing gates.
Validation:

Both methods validate the calculated speeds against a target speed (e.g., 4.5 m/s) with a tolerance (e.g., Â±10%).
Output:

Results are saved to an Excel file (speed_comparison.xlsx) with the following columns:
Filename: Name of the processed file.
Mean Speed (m/s): Speed calculated using numerical differentiation.
Valid (Mean Speed): Whether the mean speed is within the target range.
Distance-Based Speed (m/s): Speed calculated using virtual timing gates.
Valid (Distance-Based Speed): Whether the distance-based speed is within the target range.
Target Speed (m/s), Lower Bound (m/s), Upper Bound (m/s): Validation parameters.
Visualization:

Saves 2D plots for both speed calculation methods.
Generates 3D trajectory plots showing the subject's movement through the timing gates.
Parameters
The following parameters can be adjusted in the script:

folder_path: Path to the folder containing the .tsv files.
output_folder: Path to the folder where results and plots will be saved.
running_direction: Direction of movement ('x' or 'y').
TIMING_GATE_1_pos: Position of Timing Gate 1 (e.g., 1.7 m).
TIMING_GATE_2_pos: Position of Timing Gate 2 (e.g., -0.5 m).
Target_speed: Target speed for validation (e.g., 4.5 m/s).
Tolerance: Tolerance for validation in percentage (e.g., 10%).
fs: Sampling frequency of the motion capture data (e.g., 200 Hz).
plot_figure: Set to 1 to display plots during execution, or 0 to suppress them.
Outputs
Excel File:

speed_comparison.xlsx: Contains calculated speeds, validation results, and target speed parameters.
Plots:

2D plots for velocity-based and distance-based speed calculations.
3D trajectory plots showing the subject's movement through the timing gates.
Log Messages:

The script prints progress and error messages to the console for each processed file.
How to Run
Place the .tsv files in the folder specified by folder_path.
Adjust the parameters in the script as needed.
Run the script using Python:
Check the output_folder for the results and plots.
Notes
Ensure the input .tsv files contain the required columns for processing.
The script skips files that are empty or missing required columns.
Errors during processing are logged to the console but do not stop the script.
Dependencies
The script requires the following Python libraries:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
